## Instructions

The purpose of this assignment was to learn to integrate third-party API's into a web application we developed. Throughout the project I discovered how to:
### 1. Request personal API keys to access a third-party API's.
### 2. Integrate that API into my own javascript using AJAX.
### 3. Preform AJAX calls to display relevant information through DOM methods.

## This project proves to be useful
because of its range of utility across mobile and web applications. API's power a lot of apps behind the scenes and are necessary for some functions. Knowing how to implement them into your own project can be truly beneficial in accomplishing the project's goal.
